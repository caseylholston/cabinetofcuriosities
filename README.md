# cabinetofcuriosities
This is the final project for the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp. I started with a react template from a class exercise and modified for my use case. I used a Mongo DB installation to hold user specific data. The application backend was built using express and node.

This is deployed to Heroku at https://invulnerable-choucroute-57721.herokuapp.com/
